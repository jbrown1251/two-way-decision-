# individual 6 
This code has two separate problems.
Problem 1 looks at a list of weekly sales and figures out which day had the highest sales, then prints the amount and the day.
Problem 2 asks the user to keep entering numbers until they type 0, stores those numbers in a list, and then prints the list and finds the range (the difference between the largest and smallest number).
